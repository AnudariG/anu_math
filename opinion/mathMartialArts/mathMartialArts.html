  <h1>Math &amp; Martial Arts</h1>

  <p>
    Math is the most hated subject in school then second on the list comes physical education. I would argue that both of them are the most useful subjects and do not deserve that kind of treatment. We all can agree that math is not easy but like any other subject, it is how it's taught that can change everything. At this point loving or hating math seems to be a luck issue. If you are lucky you might get a good teacher that explains each topic in detail, does not use new or tricky problems for the test, believes that everyone equally can learn to be good in math. Some math problems are painful just like how running a mile is painful. And pain is something that we try to avoid at all costs. But as we develop, we learn that pain is necessary for improvement. Pain means a new level and new territory. Without it life is meaningless. But the problem is that pain is an instant uneasy feeling but improvement happens over a long period. While running or training for martial arts slowly develops your muscles, the brain is also a muscle that needs to be constantly fed and trained. People that are good in math are not necessarily gifted individuals, they have merely solved enough problems to see the pattern and apply it to others.

    Math is not just about numbers, just like Martial Arts is not just about fighting. Numbers are very abstract, that’s why we usually tie them to objects such as apples which lets us imagine doing different operations on those objects. I truly believe that the notion of talent when it comes to math and martial arts is a myth. A person could be talented but for me, talent is something developed over time but not born with. Teachers need to be equally strict and giving to all students. Looking down on a student because of how sluggish or too talkative in class will not help the teaching process. Giving a student a simpler problem because you believe they are not at the same level as other students eventually would harm them. This prevents development and harms their confidence. Jiu-Jitsu, a family of Japanese martial arts, is gaining popularity because it teaches techniques for a weaker and smaller opponent to defend or even win against a much bigger and seemingly stronger opponent. If a bigger opponent was a math problem, you would feel much better if you solved that one instead of a smaller guy. It is like winning a 10-year-old in a chess game. It is exciting when you are also 10 or younger but when you are 40 not so much.

    One move gently leads to the other. In Jiu-Jitsu, one move can open a new possibility for a new technique to be used on the opponent. Usually, when you are stuck you are constantly trying to find a way out or you might get choked. In math, previous sets of problems become the basis for future ones. All neatly tied together like a spider web. Some might come before the others like prerequisites, but others are at the same level but still connected. If you decide to skip or lose focus on one important math topic you lose the structure until you go back and review. Some math problems can be solved by the context of the chapter or exercises that come before it. If the book’s one through 5th problems are solving equations, there is a high chance that the 6th-word problem is going to use some type of equation in solving the problem.

    Math is the root of all sciences but what is science? By definition, science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding with evidence. If we follow this definition then our current school system doesn’t teach the science aspect of math. We hardly learn how to apply math knowledge to our lives which defeats the purpose of learning it in the first place. We don’t know who will be the next Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Maryam Mirzakhani, so we teach everyone equally. But math is more than that. You don’t need to make the next scientific advances in history to show that math is useful for your life. But some teachers treat students that way, where every test is the biggest test of your life. Where you need to come up with ways to solve a certain problem that you have never seen before. But in the classroom we need to be teaching kids, merely the tools so later they can use them for better, for something that they want to use it for. Tests should only check if kids are on track and learning the technique in solving a mathematical problem that the teacher already showed in great detail. Tests are not there to fail the students but to see if the teacher’s technique is suitable for that group of students and if he or she should change it. Students should constantly be reminded why they are learning a certain topic for motivation. For example, solving equations is pretty abstract but if we remind students that the variable can be anything they want. I’ve heard many students complain about why x is so important to find. This means the teacher forgot to teach the most important part which is x is not important at all and you can switch it with anything: other letters, items, or people. Whatever you wish to calculate you can replace x with it.

    Let's imagine a scene. A stranger comes up to you and starts to teach Jiu-Jitsu moves in Chinese and forces you to copy them. Of course, you don’t understand that stranger so you fail. You get punished for not understanding but they showed you the move only once and fast. The worst part is, they don’t even tell you if it's practical or not, so the whole time you think you are wasting your time. Well believe it or not elementary school is exactly like this. So many new terms and you are not allowed to question anything. Math is a language itself, that’s why explaining new topics starts with definitions. In Jiu-Jitsu, there are also new terms to learn like triangle choke, bridge, roll, etc. But it is immediately followed by a real-life example and it is shown as many times as you need. Also, you get to try it right away. If you make a mistake the coach fixes you right away. But in math class, the definition itself is hard to understand and not clear in the first place. And by the time the teacher gets to the example kids’ focus is lost somewhere in the universe.

    Math helps you stay calm and steady under stressful situations by immediately turning your critical and logical thinking so you can get to solving the problem right away. Instead of panicking or worrying about the problem mathematicians try to solve it in any way. They might come up with an algorithm or a temporary way to deal with it which is always better than sitting and worrying about what will happen next. This is why parents and teachers who are working with kids should never give negative emotions when dealing with math errors and mistakes. No matter how absurd the reasoning or the answer is, the mere fact of brain mechanics working to get to that answer is enough. Kids need to see a positive look on making mistakes which leads to less anxiety and depression in the future. And adults are also not so late to change their habits. We all have a little voice in our head either encouraging us like a proud mother or discouraging us like our worst enemy. If we start to hear that negative voice, we need to turn on our conscious mind and gently make it silent, because when a big problem arises we usually start to hear that voice saying “this is so hard” or “I can’t do this” or “I don’t think we ever learned this” instead of focusing on what we are reading. There is an important process going on in your brain to solve this problem but that voice keeps interrupting you, but you have total control over it. Just need to realize it and take it.

    Math is a form of art. It has a flow and energy. Combined with other tools you can create something beautiful. Math is heavily used in computer science which also looks hard and boring, but also so integrated into modern life that it is an unavoidable skill for everyone. Only by learning the boring parts like learning the keywords and coding syntaxes do you get to the exciting part of creating art with computer science. Using your imagination is considered creative. A good example is painting but coding also requires imagination, creativity, and flow. It is not as black and white as dealing with numbers and functions.

    Some teachers are good at what they are doing but simply bad at explaining. A task when repeated so many times, there comes a point when you start to not care about the simplest error. We see this when math teachers tend to skip the simple algebra part of the problem because they have repeated that exact problem thousands of times. But in the students' eyes, this is the first time they are seeing it which creates a gap. Repetition can improve your skills but also it might lead to bad habits being built into your system, not knowingly. In martial arts, a simple mistake can lead to fatal injury. You learn a move, and you perfect it until it becomes natural. Only then do you start to think about different techniques and tricks. Success is not necessarily in the repetition, but it is doing the right thing and building on it each time. That is why reviewing the old information is the best action for success. Good teachers usually mention the previous class topics or formulas and explain each problem in detail. I had a big ego and would not pay attention when the teacher would have a review before the school started.
