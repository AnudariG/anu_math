    <h3>Death to Humans</h3>
    <p>
      I think I am not suffering enough, too comfortable to the point, my brain starts to create fictional problems. At night when the lights are off and I am deep in my bed, I start to think about death. Death is scary. It is natural to be scared of death, just like it is natural to die. <a href="death/death.html">click to read in length</a>

    <h3>Math &amp; Martial Arts</h3>

    <p>
      Math is the most hated subject in school then second on the list comes physical education. I would argue that both of them are the most useful subjects and do not deserve that kind of treatment. We all can agree that math is not easy but like any other subject, it is how it's taught that can change everything. At this point loving or hating math seems to be a luck issue. If you are lucky you might get a good teacher that explains each topic in detail, does not use new or tricky problems for the test, believes that everyone equally can learn to be good in math. Some math problems are painful just like how running a mile is painful. And pain is something that we try to avoid at all costs. But as we develop, we learn that pain is necessary for improvement. Pain means a new level and new territory. Without it life is meaningless. But the problem is that pain is an instant uneasy feeling but improvement happens over a long period. While running or training for martial arts slowly develops your muscles, the brain is also a muscle that needs to be constantly fed and trained. People that are good in math are not necessarily gifted individuals, they have merely solved enough problems to see the pattern and apply it to others.
    </p>

      Math is not just about numbers, just like Martial Arts is not just about fighting. Numbers are very abstract, thatâ€™s why we usually tie them to objects such as apples which lets us imagine doing different operations on those objects. I truly believe that the notion of talent when it comes to math and martial arts is a myth. A person could be talented but for me, talent is something developed over time but not born with. Teachers need to be equally strict and giving to all students. Looking down on a student because of how sluggish or too talkative in class will not help the teaching process. Giving a student a simpler problem because you believe they are not at the same level as other students eventually would harm them. This prevents development and harms their confidence. Jiu-Jitsu, a family of Japanese martial arts, is gaining popularity because it teaches techniques for a weaker and smaller opponent to defend or even win against a much bigger and seemingly stronger opponent. If a bigger opponent was a math problem, you would feel much better if you solved that one instead of a smaller guy. It is like winning a 10-year-old in a chess game. It is exciting when you are also 10 or younger but when you are 40 not so much.  <a href="mathMartialArts/mathMartialArts.html">click to read in length</a>

      <h4>What's Math Got To Do With It? <br>
      by Joe Boaler <br></h4>
      How Teachers and Parents Can Transform Mathematics Learning and Inspire Success. <br>
      <p>Even thought it says for Teachers and Parents, I think anyone who is trying to learn math can get some helpful insights on how to effectively learn math. Most of the tricks and techniques are for elementary or middle school kids but as a College Math Tutor those still apply to adults of any age. Or even if you are not math major or have any interest in math it is a great way to find out why you don't like or even hate math. It has various concrete research and might answer the questions that you never even thought about. </p>

      <h4>Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions <br>
      by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths </h4>
      <p>
        This book gave me new perspective on coding and computer development. Brings out very interesting topics. If you need motivation to study computer science, this book will get you excited about computer world. It touches on human psychology and how it is connected to programming and algorithms. I didn't expect this but this book helped me get ready for my Data Structures class because it explains Optamization, Big O, Caching, Sorting and many other CS topics.
