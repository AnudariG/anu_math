  <h1>Death to Humans</h1>
  <p>
    I think I am not suffering enough, too comfortable to the point, my brain starts to create fictional problems. At night when the lights are off and I am deep in my bed, I start to think about death. Death is scary. It is natural to be scared of death, just like it is natural to die. 
  </p>

  <p>
    All living creatures are scared of death. I am not that special. No one is special. Does that mean everyone is special? We are all tightly connected to each other. Life is impossible without other humans. Life is impossible without everything that is on earth and beyond the earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Forest is a horrible place, there is death everywhere. Newborn chick is being eaten alive by fire ants. Wolf pack is tired and hungry because they were not able to hunt in the last few days. Every living creature is on the verge of death yet they don’t have time to sit down and think about death itself for hours. Are they just not capable enough to think deeply about life and the purpose of being alive? Are they simply stupid? Well there are humans who live in this world right now, who never heard of depression, anxiety and suicide. Are they dumb to live that way? Certainly, not. Days simply pass, busy making sure they stay alive. And when you are alive you are happy. You simply have no time to be sad. Their problems are real problems. Life threatening problems. My problem is not  getting that 10% promotion on my north face order, which is going to be shipped, from hundreds and hundreds of miles away from where I live. And I have no idea how that process goes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People complain about the hardship and uncomfort. With today’s standards trying “survive” or “getting ends meet” is simply being homeless or on the verge of homelessness. Although being homeless is a horrible situation, you still have a higher chance of surviving compared to other animals. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Am I lacking empathy for my fellow humans? That is the ultimate problem. People like to group things. The world in continents. Continents in countries. Countries in cities. Cities in towns and so on. It is always us versus them. When the problem you face is not a problem at all, convincing needs to happen. They have convinced you that you need a better house, that you need a car, that you need a family, so that they can profit from you. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Then what should I do? Do I just drop everything and go live in the woods? I am the baby of this society. Compared to wild animals I am blind, weak and inexperienced. Basically a piece of meat that decided to move into their neighborhood. Even ants could chew on my soft skin and turn me into a skeleton in a few days. Even if I do everything right and keep myself safe, nature will kill me one day. It could be an accident, natural disaster or just old age.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything on this earth is a product of nature. Even serial killers are a product of nature. Life is a big formula and every variable in it follows it. I cannot avoid any of these but living in fear is not living. Fear is a mere tool. You don't live in it, you control it.
